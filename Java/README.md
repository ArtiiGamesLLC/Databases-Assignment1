This is a command line java interface made specifically to read and write data from the included .SQL database file.
If you've followed the instructions in the root of this repository, then you will be able to run the PaperReviewDriver.java file

The java file is an interface with flow that will ask you for input at various points in order to make your queries. Simply follow
